# My Personal st-setup

I use this [st (simple terminal)](https://st.suckless.org/)-setup as my default terminal-emulator.

My changes:

* Change font to [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/)
* Add patch for transparent background and set [alpha](https://st.suckless.org/patches/alpha/)
* Add patch for [scrolling](https://st.suckless.org/patches/scrollback/) in terminal history
* Add patch for [ligatures](https://st.suckless.org/patches/ligatures/)
* Add patch for [dracula-theme](https://st.suckless.org/patches/dracula/)

For alpha to work, I use [picom](https://github.com/yshui/picom) as compositor.
