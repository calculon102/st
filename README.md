# My Personal st-setup

I use this [st (simple terminal)](https://st.suckless.org/)-setup in my [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/)-setup.

Technically this is a fork, but since all configuration in these suckless-projects is done via compilation, I call it a setup.

My changes:
* Changed font to [Hack](https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/) via config.h
* Added patch for transparent background and set [alpha](https://st.suckless.org/patches/alpha/)
* Added patch for [scrolling](https://st.suckless.org/patches/scrollback/) in terminal history
